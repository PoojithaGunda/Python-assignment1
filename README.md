What is Git?

Git is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

What Is GitHub? 

GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

What Is Version Control?

Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress… At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code. Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.

What is Repository?

A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. When you create a repository, you can choose to make the repository public or private. Repositories in organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud and are owned by an enterprise account can also be created with internal visibility.

How are softwares are using github? 

Git is used to tracking changes in the source code. The distributed version control tool is used for source code management. It allows multiple developers to work together. It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches.

#Python assignment 1:


1)This program explain about how to find out the floor division of two numbers:
In Python, we can perform floor division (also sometimes known as integer division) using the // operator.
This operator will divide the first argument by the second and round the result down to the nearest whole number, 
making it equivalent to the math. floor() function.


2)You are given words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences.
The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word. See the sample input.
in this i have used dictionary and simple if to solve the problem.


3)In Python, we can implement a matrix as a nested list (list inside a list). We can treat each element as a row of the matrix.
For example X = [[1, 2], [4, 5], [3, 6]] would represent a 3x2 matrix.
First row can be selected as X[0] and the element in first row, first column can be selected as X[0][0].
We can perform matrix addition in various ways in Python. 


4)A palindrome is a string that is the same read forward or backward.
For example, "dad" is the same in forward or reverse direction. Another example is "aibohphobia", which literally means, an irritable fear of palindromes.


5)It is pretty easy to get the sum of values of a python dictionary. You can first get the values in a list using the dict. values().
Then you can call the sum method to get the sum of these values.


6)The numbers whose reverse is same as the original number are termed as Palindrome.
For Example: A number 12321 is a palindromic number because its reverse is 12321 which is equal to the original number.
Here we are printing  the Pyramid of Palindromes. The number of elements in each row increases as we go down.


7)in this program one just has to run a Python loop and append the characters as they come and build a new string from the existing one except when the index is i. 
Drawback: The major drawback of this approach is that it fails in case there as duplicates in a string that match the char at pos. i. replace() replaces all 
the occurrencesof a particular character and hence would replace all the occurrences of all the characters at pos i.
We can still sometimes use this function if the replacing character occurs for 1st time in the string. 


8)A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00).
The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400. 



9)in this program we are printing the numbers sepated by dots by asking input form the user.



10)# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
we are reading the input from the user and passing the same into the funtion.
